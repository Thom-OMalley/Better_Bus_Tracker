The Better Bus Tracker (BBT) is a tool to help those with a regular preferred route to get more information about their bus, its location, and its arrival time.
BBT is not a trip planner. It is intended for riders who already know the route they wish to use.
Simply search for your stop, select your desired route, and, if applicable, the direction of the bus.
BBT will then display the number of minutes away the next bus on your chosen route is from your chosen stop, its last stop, next stop, name, and a map of its last reported geographical position.
BBT will also display the number of minutes away of the bus after next, should you miss the next bus, or should you wish to plan further ahead.  It will also display the very last pickup of the day for your chosen route and stop.
BBT will automatically update the minutes, stops, and map once every minute.
